# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

# The Gaming Room, a client from Creative Technology Solutions (CTS), wants to develop a web-based game that can run on multiple platforms.
# The game, "Draw It or Lose It", is only available on Android operating systems.

# The requirements for the game are: ability to have one or more teams involved, ability to assign multiple players to different teams, 
# and ability to check whether a team name or user name is taken when choosing a name. To add, only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

# I consider the Domain Model to be the part of the documentation that I did particularly well. While challenging, being able to create the UML Diagram helped me in developing the game further
# and the rest of the documentation. Being able to see the relationship between classes allowed me to understand better what I was working with at the moment, and how could I continue to
# improve it further.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

# The constraints and requirements. For me,these were two of the most essential parts from the document that were helpful in developing the code (apart from the UML Diagram).
# Having the constraints and requirements at hand allowed me to develop the code properly for the game application and meet the software requirements set by the client.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

# Personally, if I were to revise one part, I'd revise them all, while placing emphasis on constraints and requirements (I would review the requirements to ensure I'm doing the documentation, as well as the code, correctly). 
# Each part is connected to one another, and it is essential to maintain all of them updated, along with the code.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

# By summarizing the user's needs and setting the requirements, we are able to implement them in the software design. It is also important to keep in mind the user's needs.
# If the user's needs are not met when developing, then the game application would never be deployed to other operating systems, and so on. It would remain within the Android OS.
# The user's needs are at the core of many applications. If we fail to meet these needs, we are limiting ourselves, as well as limiting the success of the application.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

# The best approach to designing software, for me, is working in one part at a time, rather than on all. Viewing the code (or any software application) as a whole, can sometimes be overwhelming. 
# As for techniques or strategies, I would recommend sharpening your skills and practicing as much as you can.
